Hi, I am Anthony.

- Title: "From Design Dabbler to Code Conqueror: The Adventures of Anthony"
- Summary: ðŸŽ¨ Graduated in Visual Communication Design, but ended up in Marketing because I just couldn't resist measuring the impact of my digital doodles. After a decade of marketing mischief, I decided to chase my dream of becoming a CTO â€“ but alas, no one wanted to hire me! So, I did what any self-respecting dreamer would do: I hired myself! Now, I'm the CTO of my own little empire, cooking up some spicy SAAS technology.
- Skillset: ðŸ’» Started off as a no-code enthusiast, but quickly hit the ceiling â€“ turns out, there's only so much you can do with drag-and-drop! So, I rolled up my sleeves and dove headfirst into the coding abyss. Now, I'm like a digital wizard, conjuring up solutions faster than you can say "Hello, World!" Need someone to turn your digital dreams into reality? Look no further, I've got just the code for that!
